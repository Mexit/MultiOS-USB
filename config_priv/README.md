You can save your own configurations in this directory. They will not be deleted during the automatic MultiOS-USB update.

You do not need to create configurations from scratch.  
Just copy the one you want from the `/MultiOS-USB/config` directory, paste it into this directory and update it according to your needs.  
The updated configuration will be detected automatically.

Once you have created a new configuration or updated an old one, you can upload the changes to the repository and share the code here:
https://github.com/Mexit/MultiOS-USB/issues

To use the example configuration file remove `-example` from `/MultiOS-USB/config_priv/example/lmde.cfg-example`  
You can also create new directories to organize your configuration files.
